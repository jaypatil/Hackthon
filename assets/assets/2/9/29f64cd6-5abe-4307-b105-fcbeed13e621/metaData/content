	     personal income and disposable personal income

beay’s personal income measures the incomeeceived by persons from participation in production, from government and business transfers, and from holding interest-bearing securities and corporate stocks. personal income also includes income received by nonprofit institutions serving households, by private non-insured welfare funds, and by private trust funds. bea also publishes disposable personal income, which measures the income available to households after paying federal and state and local government income taxes.

income from production is generated both by the labor of individuals (for example, in the form of wages and salaries and of proprietors’ income) and by the capital that they own (in the form of rental income of persons). income that is not earned from production in the current period—such as capital gains, which relate to changes in the price of assets over time—is excluded.

bea’s monthly personal income estimates are one of several key macroeconomic indicators that the national bureau of economic research considers when datinginess cycle.

personal income and disposable personal income are provided both as aggregate and as per capita statistics. bea produces monthly estimates of personal income for the nation, quarterly estimates of state personal income, and annual estimates of local-area personal income. more information is found on bea's website.

census money income

the census bureau collects income data on several major surveys, including the annual social and economic supplement (asec) of the current population survey (cps), the survey of income and program participation (sipp), and the american community survey (acs). the cps is the source of the official national estimates of poverty and the most widely cited source of annual household income estimates for the united states.[8]

the cps measure of money income is defined as the total pre-tax cash income received by people on a regular basis, excluding certain lump-sum payments and excluding capital gains.

the census bureau also produces alternative estimates of income and poverty based on broadened definitions of income that include many of these income components that are not included in money income.

the census bureau releases estimates of household money income as medians, percent distributions by income categories, and on a per capita basis. estimates are available by demographic characteristics of householders and by the composition of households. more details on income concepts and sources are found on the census bureau’s website.

income distribution

of those individuals with income who were older than 25 ars of age, over 42% had incomes below $25,000 while the top 10% had incomes exceeding $82,500 a year. the distribution of income among individuals differs substantially from household incomes as 42% of all households had two or more income earners. as a result 20.5% of households have six figure incomes, even though only 6.24% of americans had incomes exceeding $100,000. the following chart shows the income distribution among all 211,832,000 individuals aged 15 or higher as recorded by the united states census bureau.
