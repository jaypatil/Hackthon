      500 index (vfinx)
    

  

  
    as the industry’s first index fund for individual investors, the 500 index fund is a low cost way to gain diversified exposure to the u.s. equity market. the fund invests in 500 of the largest u.s. companies, which span many different industries and account for about three-fourths of the u.s. stock market’s value. the key risk for the fund is the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. because the 500 index fund is broadly diversified within the large-capitalization market, it may be considered a core equity holding in a portfolio.

  during the 1980s and 1990s southwest air (luv) was a great investment story. since then the company's performance has stalled, and it now performs like any other airline stock -- which is to say, poorly.

i knew southwest's story from my college days in texas. i know why its symbol is luv – its original hub was dallas' love field. i knew that for years iavoided regulation by flying only within texas, mostly in a triangle of dallas, houston and san antonio. and i knew vaguely of what it had done since.

but living in atlanta, i lost track of southwest until my daughter went to college in texas, and i found the only way to come back from driving her stuff there was to fly in through birmingham and then have someone drive me home.

the carrier's fares were half those of all competitors flying into atlanta, there were no bag fees, and my own experience with it was positive. they're frank about being a bus line. no romance of the air. let's get along and we'll all get through this. nice.

once southwest announced the acquisition of airtran, i noticed immediately that delta (dal) matched its birmingham prices, at least to texas. that's one reason why its stock no longer performs like a tech stock. the hub-and-spoke guys find a way to match fares, then add up-charges (like the bag fees and change fees) once they get you in. i'd rather fly southwest.

this was the first quarter where airtran's results are plugged into southwest's numbers. (read a transcript of the earnings call here.) southwest is complaining about fuel costs, like everyone else, so if the end of the libyan civil war does indeed mean lower fuel prices, they will benefit on the bottom line.

the big news is that airtran is being integrated into the larger whole. despite its union contracts, despite its slightly different way of routing planes, despite its different fleet mix, the two are becoming one, and that process should be complete within a year.

southwest also announced its first direct service through atlanta, and once all airtran flights are southwest flights, i know things will change at atlanta's hartsfield-jackson airport. delta will no longer be the sole owner of this market.

question is, how much will they change, and will that change be enough to get southwest's performance ahead of the airline pack again?

despite its stock performance, southwest retains many advantages over airlines like delta. it has a better balance sheet. it's growing, not shrinking. it has no huge international exposure. it retains its generally good reputation for customer service, unlike discount rival jetblue.

right now southwest stock is selling at a p/e of just 12, which is in line with the market as a whole. with the airtran acquisition complete and the company starting to ramp up operations in the east and south, that should have a positive impact on earnings in 2012 and beyond. if you believe the u.s. economy is going to grow next year (and not everyone does) then i think southwest will get more than its share of that growth.

if you are a bull on america, in other words, you should be a bull on southwest air too.

disclosure: i have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

  dynamic factors affect crude prices
crude oil and, by default, gasoline prices, are driven by a complex assortment of factors that affect supply and demand, including geopolitical risks, weather, inventories, global economic growth, exchange rates, speculation, hedging and investment activity. from the risk of piracy in the straits of malacca and hormuz, to transit vulnerability in the caspian and extreme weather in the united states, crude is constantly susceptible to a variety of price-driving forces.


the worldwide demand for crude oil, gasoline and petroleum products that are made from crude is expected to increase as the u.s. and global economies strive to recover. this growing demand, coupled with political instability in the middle east and north africa (mena) region and the decline in the u.s. dollar's value, are what pushed gasoline prices to $4 per gallon earlier this year. while gas prices climbed, the average cost for crude oil rose from about $90 per barrel in mid-february, 2011, to about $127 per barrel two months later.




figure 1 shows average regular gasoline prices in the u.s. over the past three years. crude oil and gasoline reached record highs during 2008, following surges in worldwide demand due in part to increased demand from emerging markets like china and india. during the second half of 2008, demand and prices both tumbled in response to deteriorating economic conditions. from june to december of 2008, gasoline prices fell from just over $4 per gallon to $1.59. prices rose steadily through the middle of 2009, bounced up and down for the next year, and then by september 2010, gas prices took off with unrelenting daily price increases. fears of $6 gas, a slowing economy and decreased demand put the brakes on the uptrend, and price increases finally slowed by mid-may, 2011.


where do our dollars go at the pump?
according to the eia data from 2010, 68% of every dollar at the gas pump goes to crude oil - the raw material used to produce gasoline. refining the crude oil into gasoline and retailing, which includes distribution and marketing, adds 18% to the price that consumers pay for gasoline. the remaining 14% of every dollar goes towards excise taxes.

in the united states, the federal government excise tax is currently 18.4 cents per gallon. the average fuel tax paid by consumers, however, is 49.5 cents per gallon. the difference comes from state and local government taxes, which vary widely across the u.s. the tax in alaska, for example, is about 26 cents per gallon; in connecticut, the rate is more than 70 cents per gallon.

perhaps surprisingly, the united states produces 51% of the oil and petroleum products that it consumes. the rest is imported from other countries, including canada at the top of the list (25%); saudi arabia (12%); venezuela (10%) and mexico (9%).

what's ahead?
the energy information administration (eia) expects that the annual price of wti (west texas intermediate) crude will average $103 per barrel in 2011 and $107 per barrel in 2012; the 2010 average was $79. the eia projects rising crude costs will add an average of 85 cents more per gallon of gasoline during 2011, with an additional three cents per gallon during 2012. the 2010 average regular pump price was $2.78 per gallon; eia's forecast for 2011 and 2012 is $3.63 and $3.66, respectively.

despite these carefully crafted forecasts, any one of a vast number of factors could trigger strong changes in crude and gasoline prices - both to the upside and downside.

up and down (and up and down)
the weak u.s. dollar only exaggerates rising global oil prices for american consumers. countries with strong currencies, including those using the euro and the yen, are generally exposed to smaller price increases. though high gas prices are never welcome, they have come at a particularly tricky time as unemployment and foreclosure rates remain high and food prices soar. while gas prices in the u.s. are still a dollar higher than this time last year, they continue to drop from the early may highs.
