from east egg, then, came the chester beckers and the leeches, and a man named bunsen, whom i knew at yale, and doctor webster civet, who was drowned last summer up in maine. and the hornbeams and the willie voltaires, and a whole clan named blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. and the ismays and the chrysties (or rather hubert auerbach and mr. chrystie’s wife), and edgar beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.

clarence endive was from east egg, as i remember. he came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named etty in the garden. from farther out on the island came the cheadles and the o. r. p. schraeders, and the stonewall jackson abrams of georgia, and the fishguards and the ripley snells. snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that mrs. ulysses swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. the dancies came, too, and s. b. whitebait, who was well over sixty, and maurice a. flinnd the hammerheads, and beluga the tobacco importer, and beluga’s girls.
