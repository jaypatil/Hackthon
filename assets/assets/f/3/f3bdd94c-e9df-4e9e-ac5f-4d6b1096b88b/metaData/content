	     investment banking

an investment bank is a financial institution that assists individuals, corporations and governments in raising capital by underwriting and/or acting as the client's agent in the issuance of securities. an investment bank may also assist companies involved in mergers and acquisitions, and provide ancillary services such as market making, trading of derivatives, fixed income instruments, foreign exchange, commodities, and equity securities.

an advisor who provides investment banking services in the united states must be a licensed broker-dealer and subject to securities & exchange commission (sec) and financial industry regulatory authority (finra) regulation.

possible conflicts of interest

conflicts of interest may arise between different parts of a bank, creating the potential for market manipulation. authorities that regulate investment banking (the fsa in the united kingdom and the sec in the united states) require that banks impose a chinese wall to prevent communication between investment banking on one side and equity research and trading on the other.

some of the conflicts of interest that can be found in investment banking are listed here:

	many investment banks also own retail brokerages. also during the 1990s, some retail brokerages sold consumers securities which did not meet their stated risk profile. this behavior may have led to investment banking business or even sales of surplus shares during a public offering to keep public perception of the stock favorable.
	since investment banks engage heavily in trading for their own account, there is always the temptation for them to engage in some form of front running – the illegal practice whereby a broker executes orders for their own account before filling orders previously submitted by their customers, there benefiting from any changes in prices induced by those orders.
