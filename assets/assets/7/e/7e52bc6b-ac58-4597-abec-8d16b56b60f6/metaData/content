    tiffany (tif) is out this morning with, in all actuality, an abnormally robust second quarter. it's not that we were expecting an acute deceleration in the company's global fortunes as a result of the economic headlines of the second quarter. rather, we were bracing for pockets of weakness, little indications of the macro story coming home to roost in a retailer than has been on fire for longer than a year. at the moment, we are hard pressed to find negative aspects to the quarter, only a bunch of interesting positives.

first was the 120 bps y/y expansion in gross margin, happening despite higher precious metal and gem costs. in our view, the company continues to benefit from purchases of inventory made at lower prices and of course, price increases throughout the assortment. raised prices plus the type of raw demand being realized in the likes of asia and the nyc flagship is a recipe for a success, and the $0.17 ex. items eps that crossed the tape. second interesting aspects were how well japan and europe did on comparable store basis. as we have mentioned before regarding tiffany and europe, its stores are overall positioned in countries that are not generally known as profligate spenders. japan and how it has bounced back was a surprise (and is a surprise in other retail 2q11 earnings).

now onto a touch of the tarnish. although tiffany raised its fy11 eps guidance it mostly reflected 2q11 upside, suggesting a more cautious outlook for the second half (encompassing some of the cautious comments lately by retailers). within that outlook, tiffany's neglected to mention europe as being a strong component to third quarter to date worldwide sales, leaving us to wonder if trends have decelerated sharply.

the question you may be asking is whether to buy the stock in the face of such dour news on the consumer, whether it's middle income households are more recently, the higher income brackets. to that moment of introspection i would offer this; buy shares of tiffany as their inventory is being undervalued by the market. if that makes but modest sense, consider the identifiable momentum globally in the company's business, robust balance sheet, and wide moat around its business that keeps competitors at bay. tiffany is the company an investor should be seeking to own on market corrections, which has been the case as of late.
