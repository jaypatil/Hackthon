				dividend growth fund (vdigx)
			

			
			
			
		

		this fund is designed to provide investors with some income while offering exposure to dividend-focused companies across all industries. the fund focuses on high-quality companies that have both the ability and the commitment to grow their dividends over time. one of the fund’s risks is the possibility that returns from dividend-paying stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market during any given period. another risk is the volatility that comes with the fund’s full exposure to the stock market. an investor with a well-balanced, long-term portfolio who seeks exposure to dividend-focused companies may wish to consider this fund.
