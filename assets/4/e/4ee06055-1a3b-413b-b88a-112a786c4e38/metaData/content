				strategic small-cap equity fund (vstcx)
			

			
			
			
		

		this actively managed fund offers broad exposure to domestic small-capitalization stocks that the advisor believes have above-average return potential. the advisor relies on a computer-driven stock selection process in an attempt to build a portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of the fund’s comparative index, while seeking to provide better returns. one of the fund’s risks is its focus on small-cap companies, which can be a volatile segment of the market. as a result, the fund’s returns may vary widely from year to year. an investor with a well-balanced, long-term portfolio who seeks exposure to small-cap companies may wish to consider this fund.
