				explorer fund (vexpx)
			

			
			
			
		

		this fund seeks to identify small u.s. companies with growth potential. because it focuses on smaller companies, the fund tends to be more unpredictable than stock funds that focus on larger companies. however, the fund’s use of multiple advisors with diverse strategies, and its broad exposure to more than 800 stocks, can help reduce—but not eliminate—risk that may come from investing in this often-volatile segment of the market. this fund may be considered complementary to a well-diversified, long-term portfolio.
