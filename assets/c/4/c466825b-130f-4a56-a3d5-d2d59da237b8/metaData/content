				capital value fund (vcvlx)
			

			
			
			
		

		this aggressive value fund takes an opportunistic approach to companies of all sizes. in other words, the fund’s advisor focuses on stocks of companies that, in the advisors’ judgment, are misunderstood and currently underappreciated by the market. the fund’s flexibility to invest in various market segments makes it somewhat unique compared to vanguard stock funds that invest in only one segment of the market. the advisor’s approach has yielded higher turnover, and wide swings in performance may occur from year to year. this fund may be considered a complementary investment to an already diversified portfolio with a long-term time horizon.
